        <h2 id="step-2-title">What is Dungeons &amp; Druddigons?</h2>
        <p>
            Dungeons &amp; Druddigons is a D&amp;D 5e Pokémon homebrew adaptation built for playing D&amp;D 5e as Pokémon player characters. Character classes and many other features remain the same as in vanilla D&amp;D 5e. But instead of typical character species, players choose a Pokémon species to play as. Instead of species features, Pokémon species have <a href="abilities.html" class="inline-link">Abilities</a>. And instead of spells and weapons, Pokémon learn <a href="moves.html" class="inline-link">Moves</a> that they can use in and out of battle.

        <h2 id="step-2-title">Design philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            You may be wondering, <q>Why would I use this system when things like Poke5e already exist?</q> To that I would say, you <em>should</em> check out Poke5e first. The system is better quality than this and more robust. I recommend taking a look at <a href="https://poke5e.app/" class="inline-link">Poke5e.app</a> before proceeding here. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said, Poke5e was built for playing as Pokémon <em>trainers</em>. While there are guides for how to adapt it for Pokémon character play, this is less balanced since it's not what the system was built for. Dungeons &amp; Druddigons simply fills a different niche, as it is designed first and foremost for players to play as Pokémon characters — such as in a Pokémon Mystery Dungeon campaign setting. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our design philosophy is two-fold. First, Dungeons &amp; Druddigons is meant to add minimal changes to vanilla D&amp;D 5e. More often than not, we rely on preexisting gameplay mechanics instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. D&amp;D veterans should have an easy time jumping in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, this is D&amp;D first and Pokémon second, mechanically speaking. What this means is, whenever there is an overlap between D&amp;D conventions and Pokémon conventions, D&amp;D's conventions are favored. For example, D&amp;D has a level system where players can range from levels 1-20. Pokémon classically also has a level system where Pokémon can range from levels 1-100. Rather than adapting Pokémon's 1-100 system to work in D&amp;D, we simply rely on D&amp;D's level system as-is.
